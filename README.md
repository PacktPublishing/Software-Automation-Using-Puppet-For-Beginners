## About the Video Course
DevOps engineers spend more time configuring their machines, deploying changes manually, and dealing with any subsequent errors, than actually building solutions that can be more helpful. And that is exactly where Puppet becomes an important player. Puppet allows you to automate the tasks that you already know how to do, which includes configuring and deploying changes to virtual machines.
Puppet is a configuration management tool that automates the way you inspect, deliver and operate your infrastructure and software. This is a powerful language that describes how to get machines to the desired state and as a tool, it interprets and applies those changes.
In this course, weâ€™ve covered the basics of Puppet including what it is, its benefits, what it is capable of doing and how it is different from other configuration management tools. You will also learn how to create a private Git repository on a Linux machine. 
This tutorial combines theory and practice to give you a perfect balance of knowledge.

At the end of this course, you will not only be familiar with the concepts behind Puppet but also know exactly how to integrate Puppet into your next project.
So, if you want to become an expert DevOps engineer and learn Puppet, then this is the perfect course for you!
